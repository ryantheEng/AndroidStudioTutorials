        Hi, my name is Ryan and I am going into my 4th year of engineering at UBC in the integrated engineering program and I am looking
        for co-op placement for 4-8 months.
        Through side projects and extracurriculars, I have learned to be resourceful
        in the projects I take on such as working on a portable smart ECG, a telemetry board for UBC Solar and a helmet assembly for assisted respiration.
        Each of these projects I knew very little about beforehand, however my resourcefulness and determination allowed me to succeed.
        I would like to work in the biomedical industry because I have some experience with low voltage system design, programming and I am passionate about
        helping people.
        \n\n
        Attached are a quick glimpse of my contributions to these projects.
        \n\n
        I hope I can help your company succeed in it\'s endeavours.
        \n\n
        Kind regards,
        \n\n
        Ryan Lee
